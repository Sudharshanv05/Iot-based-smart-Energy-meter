## 🔌 Circuit Overview

**Sensor → ESP32 → LCD + Wi-Fi → Blynk App**

- ACS712 connected to analog pin (e.g., GPIO 34)
- ZMPT101B connected to analog pin (e.g., GPIO 35)
- Relay module connected to digital pin (e.g., GPIO 25)
- I2C LCD to ESP32 via SDA/SCL
- ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi and pushes data to the Blynk dashboard

## 📲 Mobile Dashboard Setup (Blynk)

1. Create a new project
2. Add the following widgets:
   - **Gauge** for Voltage → V1
   - **Gauge** for Current → V2
   - **Gauge or Value Display** for Power → V3
   - **Button** (for Relay) → V4
3. Copy your **Auth Token** into the code

## 🔧 Calibration Note

To convert analog values to voltage and current accurately:
- Adjust `voltageFactor` (for ZMPT101B)
- Adjust `currentFactor` (for ACS712)
- Use known loads to fine-tune values

---

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Real-time values displayed on LCD
- ✅ Power = Vrms × Irms calculation accurate
- ✅ Control load via app switch
- ✅ ESP32 stable under Wi-Fi connection
